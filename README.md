# tip-and-bill
A simple tip and bill calculator to see how much the bill will cost after adding in a tip and to see how much it will cost for each person if the bill is being split. 
I can do better, but I think I'll redo it with React to make it much better.
Still need to fix the custom tip ammount. Haven't gotten that to work yet.
